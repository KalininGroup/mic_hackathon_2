# AI4Microscopy

AI4Microscopy is a repository where we have added our AI Scientist Workflow generated papers including hypotheses, figures, code files, and generated papers exploring applications of artificial intelligence to microscopy data. The repository contains hypothesis drafts, experiment folders, and generated manuscripts that document the project's exploration of AI-driven approaches for microscopy analysis and discovery.

## Project overview
AI4Microscopy collects hypotheses, experimental results, and generated manuscripts that explore using machine learning and AI to extract insights from microscopy images, automate analysis, and assist hypothesis generation. The repository appears organized around staged hypotheses (H1/H2/H3), and contains generated text artifacts (papers, hypothesis documents) that capture ideas and written outputs.

Primary aims:

We wanted to test out the automation and research capabilitues of our AI Scientist Pipeline, so we prompted it to come up with three hypothesis related to AI4Microscopy and based on that it further carried out autonomous end to end research to draft papers, code files, figures/visualizations etc. which we have added into subsequent folders called H1, H2, and H3 meaning the three hypothesis and their respective documents generated. We have also further to showcase the workflow created a Demo Video (in main branch) to aid the user understanding of how the Scientist works and does the job. To further aid the understanding we are also below attaching the screenshots of the Gradio interface we have made. 

## Repository structure
- .gitignore — standard ignore rules for the repository.
- LICENSE — repository license (please check this file for the chosen license text and any restrictions).
- README.md — (this file) high-level overview and instructions.
- Hypothesis Generated.md — a primary document containing generated hypotheses and idea drafts. (Please add a short summary or key findings here if not present already.)
- H1/ — folder for hypothesis/experiment 1 (contains files for the first set of experiments/analyses).
- H2/ — folder for hypothesis/experiment 2 (contains files for follow-up experiments or refinements).
- H3/ — folder for hypothesis/experiment 3 (contains subsequent experiments, extended analysis, or validation).
- Papers Generated/ — a directory containing generated papers, manuscripts, or drafts deriving from the hypotheses and experiments.

If any of the H1/H2/H3 folders or "Papers Generated" contain additional sub-structure (scripts, notebooks, data subsets, results), follow the conventions below when adding new items:
- experiments/
- notebooks/
- data/ (or data-links.txt with dataset pointers)
- results/
- README.md (inside each hypothesis folder describing what was done for that stage)

## How to use this repository
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/dreamboat26/AI4Microscopy.git

2. Inspect the top-level hypothesis and papers documents:
   - Read Hypothesis Generated.md for the main idea drafts and hypotheses.
   - Browse `Papers Generated/` for draft manuscripts and outputs.

3. Explore per-hypothesis folders (H1, H2, H3):
   - Each H* folder contains the experiments, analysis notebooks, and results for that stage. Open the folder README to learn more about the exact steps, datasets, and findings.
