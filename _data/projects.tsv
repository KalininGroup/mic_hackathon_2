H-001	Image-Driven Analysis of Bubble Dynamics and Foam Stability	This project presents a fully image-driven and chemistry-agnostic analysis of foam stability using time-resolved microscopy images. Interpretable bubble-scale features—such as population dynamics, coarsening rates, size heterogeneity, and spatial organization—are extracted to quantify and rank foam stability. An explainable machine-learning model demonstrates that early microscopic dynamics can reliably predict long-term macroscopic foam behavior.	https://github.com/hdaw1905/AI_Microscopy_FoamDynamics	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2_nEF3JPeE	Name: Hesham Eina Abdalla  |  Email: hesham.eina@gmail.com  |   Affiliation: Qatar University (Alumni)  |  Position: Electrical Engineer / Graduate Student	N/A	N/A	N/A	N/A	N/A	N/A	N/A	https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Zb_boYMGQE4qJyaM9pwLgDzn8vh2HvG8/view?usp=sharing
H-002	Contrastive Micrograph-Metadata Pre-Training	We implement CLIP ( Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training) but for HAADF-STEM images and paired metadata vectors. We show that it can effectively find a shared embedding space where metadata that fits to the style of of an image is embedded to vectors that have high cosine similarity to the embedded vector of the image. Similarly, metadata combinations that do not fit with the image style are pushed away. We also discuss the usefulness of the learned embedding space for a possible lightweight physics-informed denoiser	https://github.com/benke97/Stemson_Hackathon_2025	https://youtu.be/48Mi_VDoMfk	Henrik Eliasson, haoel@dtu.dk, Technical University of Denmark, Postdoc	Angus Lothian, angus.lothian@hotmail.com, Stemson (stemson.ai), Research collaborator							https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ClLsCkeDvdRuXCUoZ7SE088G1GqDdvqu1dpjRtDP6C0/edit?usp=drive_link

H-055	Uncertainty-Driven AFM Sampling  with LLM Guidance	AFM provide amazing detail, but they are incredibly slow. Scanning every single pixel is inefficient, especially when large parts of a sample might be flat or empty. Our motivation was simple: can we scan fewer lines—saving time—but still get a perfect image?	https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1tg1PkQiOBbr-sBQXQ5faEjosyOcrq7Va?usp=sharing	https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DxDkR7W56oOwQmD3GeKvU-N2x08RSBsu	Shuting Xie( rowan.xie1011@gmail.com, University of Toronto, Master's student)	Wenyi Yao(wyao45@uwo.ca, Western University, Master's student)							https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_Lcg9gxXpHDypy2Wj_ExtY8Y1Up0sVLg/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=107279992016487024370&rtpof=true&sd=true
H-056	Defect Classification for 2D-Material STEM Datasets	This project presents a physics-guided, machine learning–based framework for automated identification and classification of atomic-scale defects in HAADF-STEM images of Janus MoWSSe.

H-057	Mapping 2D-flexibility and large conformational transitions from HS-AFM with parsimonious data-driven models	The problem we tackle in this hackathon is to develop a lightweight and self-contained ML tool that helps dissect, interpret and identify both 2D-flexibility and large conformational transitions of biomacromolecules. In addition, HS-AFM could require external control and/or deep knowledge of the system, which we attempt to substitute with a conceptual CG model that reflects interfacial dynamics with surfaces of different hydropathy. The difference between our simulations and existing fitting tools, is that in our case the effects of the surface are included, and the defined observables are reduced to 2D. Hence, tackling a 2D-flexibility of domains is possible. 	https://github.com/pyF4all/ml_4_bio_mic25	https://www.canva.com/design/DAG75HPhy1s/FlxnSQl2VG5KsLDJ4TXrmw/edit?utm_content=DAG75HPhy1s&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton	Assit.

H-064	RONIN - Ronchigram based Optical Neural Inference for aberration detectioN	Aberration correction is critical for achieving high spatial resolution in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). Conventional correction relies on expert interpretation of ronchigrams, making the process slow and difficult to automate. In this project, we present RONIN, a physics-informed deep learning framework that predicts dominant electron-optical aberrations directly from ronchigram images. Using synthetically generated ronchigrams and a ResNet-based regression model, RONIN demonstrates accurate inference of several low-order aberrations, highlighting its potential for closed-loop and autonomous microscope alignment.	https://github.com/msunda17/RONIN	https://youtu.be/JG7722Slxbo	Sriram Sankar (ASU)	Manikandan Sundararaman (ASU)	Aditya Raghavan (UTK)						https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bHefdCF3I6p6G0BU7LfxV4ykWR20JqAiX8G8kZBXi5Y/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.f6i2vjaypmr2
H-065	Autonomous Identification of Metal Microstructural Features via Latent Space Mapping-Based Microscope Control	We develop an autonomous microscopy framework that uses machine learning to identify metal microstructural features directly during EBSD acquisition, without prior knowledge or human intervention. By encoding Kikuchi diffraction patterns into a latent space and adaptively guiding data acquisition, the approach efficiently resolves multiscale microstructural heterogeneity while minimizing the number of required measurements. This work provides a foundation for autonomous microstructure mapping and data-driven alloy design.	https://uofi.app.box.com/s/rqb0ojsxzx9tmwxwjgfetvl0hc64kqzz	https://uofi.box.com/s/d59ph4gn4pbtgfrc6t6u864ftosgxyr1	Pierre BELAMRI-REGENPIED, MinesParis, Ph.D. Student	Martin COURTOIS, MinesParis, Ph.D. Student	Mathieu CALVAT, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Postdoctoral researcher	Neal BRODNIK, MinesParis, Postdoctoral researcher	JC STINVILLE, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Assistant Professor	Henry PROUDHON, MinesParis, Researcher			https://uofi.box.com/s/4v2jqxffobtf061kabl76qb13bik80pe
H-066	MicrosCopilot: An Agentic, Physics‑Aware AI Framework for Confocal Microscopy 	The project is a “Microscopilot” that combines classical image processing, particle tracking, and a configurable digital twin of Brownian motion with large language model agents that guide the user through the full workflow: simulating or loading movies, detecting and tracking particles, extracting physical parameters (such as diffusion coefficients), and explaining the results in plain language for materials and tribology researchers. The system is organized as multiple cooperating agents (data loading, detection/tracking, physics analysis, and explanation) behind a simple UI so that experimentalists can quickly go from raw z‑stacks or time‑series images to quantitative, reproducible results and narrative reports during the hackathon.	https://github.com/Abhishek-Gupta-GitHub/confocal_microscopy-copilot	https://youtu.be/qtd9Qw1AoO0	Abhishek Gupta, a.kumargupta@uva.nl, University of Amsterdam, Phd student	Samuel Hee, samuelheeyi0309@gmail.com, NTU Singapore, undergrad student							https://drive.google.com/file/d/15JSY2cTtRQJEA_edUGg4QazSUNO5J5kK/view?usp=drive_link
H-067	Generative Topographical Interpretation of AFM Data	Nano-Constellations is an automated pipeline that reconstructs raw AFM data into high-fidelity 3D topographical maps of TiO2 surfaces. By implementing asymmetric cropping to eliminate edge-noise and utilizing Delaunay Triangulation for structural reconstruction, we transform raw TiO2 intensity data into a 3D geometric web. The results demonstrate a high-fidelity 3D reconstruction that allows for perspective flipping and real-time visualization of interatomic strain. 	https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1FOSMb_qawqVsCiU09nkWm2nspC5f566r?usp=sharing	https://youtu.be/d4nFid4f0qw	Sinny J.

H-068	TwinSpec: A Digital Twin Framework for GIWAXS Data, Geometry, and Physics-Aware ML	TwinSpec is a modular digital twin framework for grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) that integrates a data digital twin, an interactive lab console, and a geometry-driven visual twin. By converting literature-derived GIWAXS measurements into reproducible, instrument-aware representations and coupling them to an interactive control surface, TwinSpec enables exploration of how experimental geometry and processing conditions influence scattering outcomes without requiring synchrotron access. A lightweight, physics-aware ML module demonstrates that the resulting data infrastructure is directly usable for downstream machine learning workflows. https://www.twinspec.org	https://github.com/twinspec	https://youtu.be/tBsrDp0h4R4	Tajah Trapier, tctrapie@ncsu.edu, Materials Science and Engineering Department, North Carolina State University, Student								https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MYFuEkLLAePVujy-lrl0OXEuzmurAOIS_aSf1YrQljM/edit?tab=t.0
