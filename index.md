## 🎯 About the Hackathon

The **Machine Learning for Microscopy Hackathon** brings together researchers from microscopy, data science, and materials communities to solve *real-world problems* using AI and machine learning.  

Whether you are a microscopist, data scientist, or student exploring new tools, this hackathon is designed for you. Our mission is to **bridge microscopy and ML communities**, accelerating innovation in data-driven discovery.

For microscopists: participation from all imaging fields — electron, scanning probe, and chemical — is encouraged, covering the entire workflow from **sample selection → optimization → data analysis → interpretation**.  
For ML participants: we invite experts and enthusiasts in **image analysis, representation learning, optimization, and active learning** to help shape the next generation of intelligent microscopy tools.  

Let’s build the bridge between **AI and the nanoscale world** together!
